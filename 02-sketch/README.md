# Sketch: Pin Headers and Jumper Wires

## Brief
The teacher ask us to make hand-drawn sketches of the basic electronic components used on the Arduino on a Breadboard and refer to the style of naturalistic illustrations, draw the sketch with sections, exploded and magnified views, including short descriptive text. 

My part is Pin Headers and Jumper Wires.

## Description
### Pin Headers
There are two kinds of pin headers: male and female.

The inner part of a female pin header is a shape of fork, which can clamp a male one.

The headers are attached to the PCBboard by soldering.

### Jumper Wires
There are two three kinds of jumper wires with plastic housing: male-male wire, female-female wire and male-female wire.

The components of a jumper wire, from outside to inside, are plastic housing, conncetor and wire.

The end portion of the wire is stripped of its outer insulation to expose the copper core, placed in a connector, and then the two parts are held together using a specialized type of pliers.
