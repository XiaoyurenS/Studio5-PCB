# Input devices try-out

## Brief
Experience data collection with digital and analog input devices. We are asked to pick a digital sensor and a analog sensor from a collection and try then out with the prototyping breadboard, connect the sensors to the suitable pin-headers,  test them with a program and read the sensorsâ€™ data using the Serial Monitor. 

I chose a KY-027 mercury switch for digital and a MQ3 alcohol sensor for analog.

## KY-027 mercury switch

### Principle
![picture description](./images/KY027.jpg)
This is a module which consists of a mercury switch and a LED.

It has 4 pins. From top to bottom are:
* GND
* VCC
* Signal
* LED

When we turn over this switch, the mercury drop connects the circuite and sents the signal to ATMEGA. Then we can use the signal to control the LED.

### Code
```ruby
int switch = 0; // Define an variable for switch.

void setup() {
  pinMode(2,INPUT); // Receive the signal from mercury switch.
  pinMode(13,OUTPUT); // Power for the LED.
}

void loop() {
  switch = digitalRead(2); // Receive the signal from mercury switch.

  if(switch == 1){
    digitalWrite(13,HIGH); // When the switch is on, turn on the LED.
  }
  else{
    digitalWrite(13,LOW); // Otherwise turn off the LED.
  }
}
```
